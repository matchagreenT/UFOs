# UFOs

### Overview: 
After helping Dana with her webpage and making the dynamic tables work as intended. We help her improve her webpage by providing a more in-depth analysis with the UFOs sightings by filtering multiple criteria at the same time. On the plus side, we added a new feature in the date, where an addition to the table filters for the city, state, country and shape of the UFO.

### Summary:
One drawback to this webpage would be, though the data of the tables are not as big of a file to load on this webpage. But possibly, take a look into adding another link to the open the tables in, with more in detailed analysis of UFO sightings. 
Recommend to have menu bar to access other types of information, regarding UFO sightings and also contact link to submit possible future sightings for users.
